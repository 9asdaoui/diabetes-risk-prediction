    "#  Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rows:** 768  \n",
    "- **Columns:** 9  \n",
    "- **Description:** Medical data used to predict diabetes risk based on clinical measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Observations\n",
    "- Columns like *SkinThickness*, *Insulin*, *BMI* contain unrealistic `0` values.\n",
    "- `Unnamed: 0` is an index column → should be dropped.\n",
    "- Mean glucose level ≈ 120 → slightly high.\n",
    "- Insulin and BMI have large standard deviations → possible outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Next Steps\n",
    "1. Drop `Unnamed: 0`\n",
    "2. Replace invalid zeros with `NaN`\n",
    "3. Handle missing values using median\n",
    "4. Analyze correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Variable Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The histograms below visualize how each numerical feature is distributed.  \n",
    "We can easily detect patterns, outliers, and possible missing data issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pregnancies:** Mostly low counts, right-skewed — most women have between 0 and 5 pregnancies.  \n",
    "- **Glucose:** Slightly right-skewed with a normal-like shape — a few high values that might represent outliers.  \n",
    "- **BloodPressure:** Centered around 70–80 mm Hg — looks roughly normal, but some zeros are unrealistic and may need cleaning.  \n",
    "- **SkinThickness:** Very right-skewed — many zero values, likely missing data.  \n",
    "- **Insulin:** Highly right-skewed — a large number of zeros suggest unrecorded measurements.  \n",
    "- **BMI:** Roughly normal distribution centered around 30 — indicates many participants are overweight or obese.  \n",
    "- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Right-skewed — most participants have low genetic risk, with a few higher-risk cases.  \n",
    "- **Age:** Concentrated between 20 and 50 years — fewer older individuals in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    " **Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "These distributions highlight several key points:\n",
    "- Some variables (like `Insulin` and `SkinThickness`) have **many zero values** that may represent missing data.  \n",
    "- Most features are **right-skewed**, suggesting that **normalization or transformation** might be needed before modeling.  \n",
    "- The data shows **realistic population patterns** — e.g., BMI around 30 and glucose peaking near 120–140 mg/dL.  \n",
    "- Understanding these shapes helps in **detecting outliers**, **deciding preprocessing steps**, and **choosing suitable algorithms**.\n",

    "### Observation on Variable Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most variables show weak correlations, with a few moderate relationships:  \n",
    "- **Pregnancies & Age (0.544):** Older individuals tend to have more pregnancies.  \n",
    "- **Insulin & SkinThickness (0.437):** Higher skin thickness relates to higher insulin levels.  \n",
    "- **BMI & SkinThickness (0.393):** Higher BMI corresponds to increased skin thickness.  \n",
    "- **Glucose & Insulin (0.331):** Mild positive relationship between glucose and insulin.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the features are mostly independent, providing useful information for predictive modeling.\n",
